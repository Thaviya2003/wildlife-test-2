      <p>Sri Lanka, nestled in the heart of South Asia, boasts a remarkable tapestry of wildlife across its diverse landscapes. From the iconic Asian elephants that roam freely in parks like Udawalawe to the elusive Sri Lankan leopard gracefully navigating the terrain of Yala National Park, the island nation offers a rich mosaic of animal life. Bird enthusiasts can revel in the over 430 bird species, including endemics like the Sri Lanka Junglefowl, found in locations such as Bundala National Park and Sinharaja Rainforest. The island's reptilian residents, from snakes to crocodiles, thrive in areas like the Madu River and Bundala National Park. Sri Lanka's coastal waters are teeming with marine life, providing opportunities for whale watching in Mirissa and Trincomalee. Sinharaja Rainforest, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, shelters unique species such as the purple-faced langur and the hump-nosed lizard. Amidst the lush greenery of Horton Plains National Park and the Knuckles Mountain Range, diverse butterflies and insects contribute to the country's extraordinary biodiversity. Sri Lanka's commitment to conservation and its well-preserved national parks make it a captivating destination for those seeking an immersive experience in the wonders of the natural world.</p>

      <h2 class="headings">Endangered Species</h2>

        <img class="image-1" src="image_files/black-monkey.jpg">
        <p class="para-1">Sri Lanka, despite its rich biodiversity, faces the sobering challenge of endangered species that are under threat due to various factors. One notable example is the Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus), which faces habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching for ivory. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of wildlife corridors and protected areas, aim to mitigate these threats and ensure the survival of this iconic species. Organizations such as the Department of Wildlife Conservation in Sri Lanka work tirelessly to implement strategies for the coexistence of humans and elephants while safeguarding the long-term viability of these majestic creatures.
        <br><br>Another endangered species in Sri Lanka is the Western Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus nestor), a primate species endemic to the island. Rapid deforestation and habitat fragmentation pose significant challenges to their survival. Conservation initiatives, including reforestation projects and efforts to raise awareness about the importance of preserving their natural habitat, play a crucial role in the ongoing battle to protect the Western Purple-faced Langur and other endangered species in Sri Lanka. Collaborative endeavors between governmental and non-governmental organizations are essential to secure a future where these unique and irreplaceable species thrive in their native environment.</p>

      <h2 class="headings">National Parks</h2>
      <section class="sub-section">
        <p class="para-2">Sri Lanka is home to a network of captivating national parks that showcase the country's stunning natural beauty and diverse wildlife. Yala National Park, situated in the southeast, stands out as the most visited and second-largest national park in Sri Lanka. Renowned for its high concentration of leopards, Yala also hosts a plethora of other wildlife, including elephants, sloth bears, and a myriad of bird species. The park's varied ecosystems, ranging from dense forests to arid plains and coastal wetlands, provide a rich tapestry of habitats for both resident and migratory species. Udawalawe National Park, on the other hand, is celebrated for its thriving elephant population, offering visitors a unique opportunity to witness these gentle giants in their natural habitat. The park is centered around the Udawalawe Reservoir, creating an environment that supports a diverse range of wildlife, including water buffalo, crocodiles, and numerous bird species.
          <br><br>Sinharaja Rainforest, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a biological treasure trove and one of the last remaining expanses of virgin rainforest in Sri Lanka. Nestled in the southwestern region, Sinharaja is a haven for endemic species, both flora and fauna. The dense vegetation, towering trees, and cascading waterfalls contribute to the park's unique charm. Visitors can explore well-maintained trails to encounter rare species such as the Sri Lankan blue magpie and purple-faced langur. The conservation efforts in Sinharaja aim to protect this fragile ecosystem, highlighting the importance of preserving such pristine areas for the benefit of biodiversity and future generations.</p>

        <img class="image-3" src="image_files/Turtle01.jpg">
        <p class="para-3">Sri Lanka's extensive coastline and marine environments offer a diverse and vibrant array of marine life, making it a haven for marine enthusiasts and conservationists alike. The island's waters are frequented by various species of dolphins, including the acrobatic spinner dolphins and the larger, more majestic bottlenose dolphins. Whale watching has become a popular activity in locations like Mirissa and Trincomalee, where lucky observers may witness awe-inspiring sightings of blue whales, the largest animals on Earth, as well as sperm whales, orcas, and several species of dolphins. These marine excursions contribute not only to tourism but also to the awareness and protection of these magnificent creatures, as sustainable practices and responsible tourism play a crucial role in their conservation.
          <br><br>In addition to cetaceans, the coral reefs surrounding Sri Lanka's shores are vital ecosystems teeming with diverse marine life. Snorkelers and divers can explore these underwater wonderlands, encountering colorful coral formations and a myriad of fish species. Hikkaduwa and Pigeon Island National Park are popular marine sanctuaries, offering glimpses of vibrant coral gardens, reef sharks, turtles, and an abundance of tropical fish. Conservation efforts and marine protected areas are essential for safeguarding these underwater ecosystems, ensuring the continued health and sustainability of Sri Lanka's marine life for future generations.</p>
